                <h3>FRUITS AND VEGETABLES</h3>
                <p>Fruit and vegetables should be an important part of your daily diet. They are naturally good and contain vitamins and minerals that can help to keep you healthy. They can also help protect against some diseases.

                    Most Australians will benefit from eating more fruit and vegetables as part of a well-balanced, regular diet and a healthy, active lifestyle. There are many varieties of fruit and vegetables available and many ways to prepare, cook and serve them.
                    
                    You should eat at least five serves of vegetables and two serves of fruit each day. Choose different colours and varieties.
                    
                    A serve of vegetables is about one cup of raw salad vegetables or 1/2 cup of cooked.
                    
                    A serve of fruit is about one medium piece, 2 small pieces of 1 cup canned.</p>

            <h3>EGG & MILK</h3>
            <p>An egg is an organic vessel grown by an animal to carry a possibly fertilized egg cell (a zygote) and to incubate from it an embryo within the egg until the embryo has become an animal fetus that can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches.

                Most arthropods such as insects, vertebrates (excluding live-bearing mammals), and mollusks lay eggs, although some, such as scorpions, do not.
                
                Milk is a nutrient-rich liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food.Immune factors and immune-modulating components in milk contribute to milk immunity. Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system, and thus reduces the risk of many diseases. Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose.</p>

        <h3>OATS</h3>
        <p>The wild ancestor of Avena sativa and the closely related minor crop, A. byzantina, is the hexaploid wild oat, A. sterilis. Genetic evidence shows the ancestral forms of A. sterilis grew in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East.Oats are usually considered a secondary crop, i.e., derived from a weed of the primary cereal domesticates, then spreading westward into cooler, wetter areas favorable for oats, eventually leading to their domestication in regions of the Middle East and Europe.In 2020, global production of oats was 25 million tonnes (55 billion pounds), led by Canada and Russia with 18% and 16%, respectively, of the total (table). Other substantial producers were Poland, Spain, Finland, Australia, and the United Kingdom, each with over 1 million tonnes (2.2 billion pounds)</p>
